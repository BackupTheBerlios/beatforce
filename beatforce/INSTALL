To build beatforce with the default user interface (sdltk)

python scons.py

It is also possible to choose a different user interface by providing
the command line option ui. Currently there are three possibilities.

python scons.py ui=sdltk
python scons.py ui=gtk
python scons.py ui=qt

To install beatforce to the correct directory with the correct user interface
type one of the following:

python scons.py ui=sdltk install
python scons.py ui=gtk install
python scons.py ui=qt install
